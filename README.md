## **2.**  **Project Background** 
Now, we intend to establish a special forum for the communication of students, called **Student Exchange Forum of BJUT**. All of its design elements are based on the "student-oriented" principle, and truly build an exclusive student network platform for Beijing University of Technology. It's not just a forum, it's a community or a platform. All BJUT students here will get to know themselves completely and get everything they want. It will bring new elements to Beijing University of Technology, which pursues "newness for the future".

But now, there is no such forum in BJUT, which enables us to share, to explore, to make our own voices, and to find answers to the doubts of the world in the lost period. As students of Beijing University of Technology, we need such a platform to pursue our dreams. We need such a platform to shorten the distance of all BJUT students to make every dream chaser away from home feel warm. We need such a platform to democratize the environment in which we live so that every student can make their own voice.That's why we desperately need it.
